# Trying to make a DAW app

## What works?

Almost nothing, but the basic structure is there.

## Thins to do for next CC

- [ ] Add a way to add tracks
- [x] ~~Fix playback in the sequencer~~
- [x] ~~Fix drag and drop panels~~
- [ ] Basic quantization (snap to grid)
- [ ] Make more robust and intuitive keyboard interface
- [ ] Drag and drop pads to switch between them, so it's easier to switch between them
- [ ] Playhead dragging to move current time position
- [ ] Notes dragging to move them around
- [ ] More efficient context state management by utilizing `reselect` with `lit-context`
- [x] More efficient scheduling of audio playback events based on the current time pos + lookahead
